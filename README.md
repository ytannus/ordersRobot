# My Third Project

This robot:

* Picks orders files
* Completes the orders in the files

## Rules for the robot

* The robot should use the orders file (.csv ) and complete all the orders in the file.
* Only the robot is allowed to get the orders file. You may not save the file manually on your computer.
* The robot should save each order HTML receipt as a PDF file.
* The robot should save a screenshot of each of the ordered robots.
* The robot should embed the screenshot of the robot to the PDF receipt.
* The robot should create a ZIP archive of the PDF receipts (one zip archive that contains all the PDF files). Store the archive in the output directory.
* The robot should complete all the orders even when there are technical failures with the robot order website.
* The robot should read some data from a local vault. In this case, do not store sensitive data such as credentials in the vault. The purpose is to verify that you know how to use the vault.
* The robot should use an assistant to ask some input from the human user, and then use that input some way.
* The robot should be available in public GitHub repository.
* Store the local vault file in the robot project repository so that it does not require manual setup.
* It should be possible to get the robot from the public GitHub repository and run it without manual setup.
